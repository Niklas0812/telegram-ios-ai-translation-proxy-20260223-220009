# Placeholder Bazel target definition for Telegram-iOS integration.
# Telegram-iOS uses repository-specific Bazel macros; replace this with the exact macro/attrs
# used by the selected upstream revision once the patch series is finalized.
#
# Example (illustrative only):
# load("@build_bazel_rules_swift//swift:swift.bzl", "swift_library")
# swift_library(
#     name = "AITranslation",
#     srcs = glob(["Sources/**/*.swift"]),
#     module_name = "AITranslation",
#     visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
# )
